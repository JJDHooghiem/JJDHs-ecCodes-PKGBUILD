# ECMWF ecCodes PKGBUILD for my Arch Linux machine 
Original PKGBUILD from Graziano Giuliani taken from the AUR.
My own build, main changes to the orginal are 
``pkgver'' to be up to date with the latest version. 
Also some build flags are changes so that it compiles with gcc 10. Also
python 2 is removed as a dependency.
